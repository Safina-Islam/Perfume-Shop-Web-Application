            <h1>How do you Describe a Perfume?</h1>
            <p>Perfumes are complex and it is not easy to articulate what we smell with our noses. We struggle with the vocabulary when describing a fragrance.
    
                We might use terms such a 'nice' or 'sweet' but these are not very specific and they are our personal opinion.
                
                Instead, what is required is something like a 'perfume language' that is as objective and as neutral as possible.</p>

               <h1>Give Your Nose A Chance!</h1>
               <p>t is important not to rush an assessment, as there are numerous factors which will alter your perception on any given day, e.g. fragrances you smelled earlier in the day, the environment within which you are evaluating, what did you eat or drink recently, your own mood, etc.
    
                We also recommend smelling fragrances in a peaceful and quiet environment, to ensure your other senses do not distract the nose. For example, if somebody mentions a particular ingredient, you will notice how you suddenly also pick up the same note.</p>
